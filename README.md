Mono.Net.HttpListener
==================

This project is a fork of the Mono implementation of HttpListener, where it has been ported to .NET Core.  

It's not as complete or capable as the original .NET implementation of System.Net.HttpListener relying on HTTP.sys, but it is cross platform, and doesn't require Administrator rights to listen on all interfaces (making it perfect to serve http content for testing)  .
